# 🛡️ Web3 Smart Contract Audit Reports

Welcome to my Web3 smart contract audit portfolio. This repository showcases several audit reports I’ve conducted independently, focused on security, correctness, and gas optimization of smart contracts.

Each report is written in a professional format and follows best practices inspired by industry leaders such as **Trail of Bits**, **OpenZeppelin**, and **Code4rena**.

## 🔍 Audit Methodology

Each audit typically includes the following:

- ✅ **Project Scoping**: Understanding the intended functionality and trust assumptions.
- 🔎 **Manual Review**: Reading each line of Solidity code and analyzing key components such as access control, upgradeability, and business logic.
- 🧪 **Testing & Reproduction**: Writing Foundry/Hardhat tests to simulate potential edge cases.
- 📉 **Vulnerability Classification**: According to severity (High/Medium/Low/Informational).
- 💡 **Recommendations**: Gas optimizations, architectural suggestions, and clarity improvements.
